# What is JavaScript?

## JavaScript is awesome and it's everywhere!

In the past few years, we have seen a JavaScript explosion. 

* The web is becoming more interactive which required a whole lot more JavaScript to be written.
* The JavaScript standard (_the Spec_) is constantly evolving and becoming better
* We can write JavaScript in the browser
* We can write JavaScript on the server
* We can write JavaScript to power robots
	* Nodebots, Tessel, Johnny 5...
	* <a href="https://twitter.com/thepracticaldev/status/744552986836353025?lang=en" target="_blank">NASA uses Node on their spacesuits</a>
* We can write JavaScript to automate our computers + workflow
	* Gulp, Automator...
* Major Companies are embracing JavaScript as their language of Choice
	* Uber, Yelp, Netflix...

## Programming languages

Programming languages are used to communicate a set of instructions to a machine. There are many different programming languages for different situations / projects.

For example, Swift is used for iPhone apps. Java is used for Android Apps. Ruby, Python and PHP are great for the backend of websites and web apps. 

JavaScript is used primarily for front-end programming; things that happen in the browser. 

Programming is like having a conversation with your computer so sticking to the "grammar rules", known as the **syntax**, specific to each language is important. For example, spitting out the text "Hello World" is different in each language. Let's look at a <a href="https://excelwithbusiness.com/blog/say-hello-world-in-28-different-programming-languages" target="_blank">few examples</a>.

The role of a programmer is to think of a solution to a real-world problem and break the solution down into "code" (simple mechanical instructions that the computer can understand). The computer simply runs the series of instructions in it's environment.

## JavaScript
Instructions to the computer are given by using a series of 0’s and 1’s. Programming languages, such as JavaScript, have been created to allow us to communicate with the computer in a more natural way.

**HTML** defines the content.  
**CSS** defines the presentation.  
**JavaScript** defines the behaviour & functionality.

HTML + CSS + JavaScript = Front-end development / client-side

### Pseudocode

Sometimes when you're writing JavaScript and other programming language it can be helpful to road-map the detailed steps your program will carry out in plain English, just like we did above.  This is called **pseudocode** and it's a very helpful strategy for getting your ideas about how a program runs out down without worrying about the specific syntax of how to write it. Think of it like outlining an essay with point form notes before going back and filling in each point with complete sentences.

```json
when the user scrolls down the page:
* measure how far they've scrolled
* if they've scrolled more than 400px
	- show a tooltip
* otherwise
	- hide the tooltip
```
