# Types

Every JavaScript value has a type which determine the role it plays. Listed below are some types you will encounter.

* Numbers — Integers & decimals/floats (e.g. 10, 10.001)
* Strings — characters including spaces.   
 **Must be contained within single / double quotes or backticks** (e.g. "Hello" or 'How are you today?' or \`these are template strings\`)
* Booleans — true or false
* Undefined — means "I don't have a value"
* Null — means "I have a value of nothing"
* Objects — (to be discussed later)

The `typeof` operator can be used to check the type of a value. Try checking the type of a couple values in your console. You can even check the type of the value that is contained in a variable.

      number      
      string    
      boolean    
      object - This is a strange quirk of JavaScript as null is intended to represent nothing.
