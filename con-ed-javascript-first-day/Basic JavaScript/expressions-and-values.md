# Expressions and values

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson you will be able to: 
- Describe the difference between expressions and values.

</br>  

```js
> 1 + 1;
> 2
```

The instruction that you gave is called an **expression**. What the computer returns is a **value**. In the example above `1 + 1` is the expression `2` is the value. In the console, the value is returned immediately after you press enter.

```js
> 1 + 1; // Expression
> 2 // Value
```

**Values** are simply pieces of data (sequences of 0's and 1's).  
An **expression** is any piece of code or instruction given to the computer that produces a value.

Vocabulary is very important because it helps us ask coherent questions and adds structure to our thinking. Just as we learned **selector, rule, property and value** in CSS, go ahead and drill **expression** and **value** into your head now.
