// Try creating a "student" object. The student should have the following properties:

// 	- equipment (array)
// 	- energy (number)
// 	- grades (number)
// 	- uniform (object with top, bottoms, shoes properties)
// 	- create a method that takes in food (number of calories) and then updates energy
// 	- create a method that takes in new equipment that will update our equipment array
// 	- create a method that will change the uniform (since everyday you wear something different)
// 	- create a method study time that takes time studied (minutes) that will update our grades and deplete our energy
// 	- for every hour that you study, your grades go up by 5% (example: if your grade is 60, and you study an hour, your grade will be 65) 
// 	- for every hour you study, your energy goes down by 2. (Bonus: if your energy goes below 0, your grades go down 10%)
// 	- what happens if you use the update uniform method to change something that doesn't exist in the uniform object?
