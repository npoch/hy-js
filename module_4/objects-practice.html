        // Log into the console this sentence using the spaceship object where appropriate `Canada's spaceship, built in 2017, is currently docked at the International Space Station / in transit to the International Space Station.`



        // Without changing the object literal, create a new property called destination, and set the value to be a planet or moon in our solar system



        // Our spaceship received an update and now has two stronger rockets. 
        // Update the average speed to be twice as fast


        // Create a top speed property. The typical top speed is 30% higher than the average speed
