        // Level 1:
        // using the object above console log the following sentence:
        //`Sweet Gardens is proud to have 300 hectares full of Winter Wheat and Corn this year! Stop by Cambridge, Ontario to visit our 14 barn cats and one of our 3 employees would be glad to help you!`


        // Level 2:
        // iterate through the farm object, if the value is a number, then console.log the key and value pairs example: `There are 2 owner(s)`


        // Level 3:
        // iterate through the farm object, and if there is a nested object, then iterate through that as well. You should console log each value in all objects
